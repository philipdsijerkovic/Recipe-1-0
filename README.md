# Recipe App

Welcome to my Recipe App project, a modern web application designed to help you discover, create, and share your favorite recipes with the world. This app is built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, leveraging the best of modern web development tools and practices for a fast, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing us to create reusable UI components.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It significantly improves the startup time and offers out-of-the-box features like hot module replacement.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`, and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **Java**: Not yet added to the project
- **Spring**: Not yet added to the project
